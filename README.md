## Description

I was motivated to create a book search engine because it is a convenient way to do research on a book of interest. Utilizing GraphQL and Apollo, I was able to create a book search engine that allows users to search for books and save them to their profile.

## Installation

NA

## Usage and Testing

To use this book search engine simply navigate to the deployed application and search for a book. If you would like to save a book to your profile, you will need to create an account and login. Once you are logged in, you can save books to your profile and view them on your saved books page. Saving books will feature each book's title, author(s), description, and image. If you would like to remove a book from your profile, simply click the `Remove this book` button. Once finished, log out.
